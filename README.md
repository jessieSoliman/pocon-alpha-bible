 ### Contribute :handshake:
I have called it Alpha Bible version 1.0 because I am planning to improve it. I am planning to add a graphical user interface to it, add some useful features and also refactor my code in order for it to not to be too lengthy. If you are someone that wants to contribute just for fun or in the course of learning Python, I would be happy to collaborate with you.   
Let's learn Python together :sunglasses:
